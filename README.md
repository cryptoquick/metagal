# About
metagal is a quick little gallery backend written in PHP for my friend, [Caleb Jacob](https://github.com/iamceege). it resizes images into thumbnails, then supplies the client with information about the original photo in JSON format.

PHP isn't quite the coolest language, nor is it the most fun code to write, but the intended purpose is for the gallery to be used with basic shared hosting.

This software was so easy to write, the principles of this should be so commonplace and public knowledge, thus, it is in the Public Domain.
