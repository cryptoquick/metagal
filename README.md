metagal
=======

metagal is a quick little gallery backend written in PHP for my friend, Caleb Jacob (iamceege on github). it resizes images into thumbnails, then supplies the client with information about the original photo in JSON format.

PHP isn't quite the coolest or most fun code to write, but the intended purpose is for the gallery to be used with basic shared hosting.
